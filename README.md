# COVID-19 graph tool

Simple repository that pulls Data from John Hopkins University and renders it in dynamic javascript graphs.  
Data is pulled as a zip from their public repository, is extracted, deserialized into objects, and rendered as client side dynamic graphs.  Data is left untouched otherwise.

Note that only public data are consumed; none of the UI, Presentation, or other artifacts are cloned / utilized in this code.
